5. **Identified Issues and Recommendations**

   - The Snowflake Bronze Model Physical file (DI_Databricks_Bronze_Model_Physical_DIAS/Snowflake_Bronze_Model_Physical_1.md) was not found in the repository. Please ensure the file is present and accessible in the specified path for a complete review.
   - Without the physical model and DDL scripts, a thorough review cannot be performed. Please provide the necessary files and rerun the review process.
