_____________________________________________

1. **Alignment with Conceptual Data Model**
   * 1.1 ❌: Covered Requirements - Unable to verify as the physical data model file 'Snowflake_Bronze_Model_Physical_1.md' is missing.
   * 1.2 ❌: Missing Requirements - Physical data model/DDL not provided for review.

2. **Source Data Structure Compatibility**
   * 2.1 ✅: Aligned Elements - Source data structure for Yield Management tables is available and well-documented in 'Yield_Management_Process_Tables.txt'.
   * 2.2 ❌: Misaligned or Missing Elements - Cannot verify alignment due to missing physical model/DDL.

3. **Best Practices Assessment**
   * 3.1 ❌: Adherence to Best Practices - Not assessable without the physical model/DDL.
   * 3.2 ❌: Deviations from Best Practices - Not assessable without the physical model/DDL.

4. **DDL Script Compatibility**
   * 4.1 ❌ Snowflake SQL Compatibility - Not assessable; DDL scripts not provided.
   * 4.2 ✅ Used any unsupported Snowflake features - No evidence of unsupported features in the available documentation, but DDL not provided for full verification.

5. **Identified Issues and Recommendations**

   - The required physical data model file ('Snowflake_Bronze_Model_Physical_1.md') is missing from the input directory. Please provide the DDL/model file for a complete review.
   - The source data structure is well-documented and ready for mapping once the physical model is available.
   - Ensure that the physical model includes all tables and columns as described in the source data structure, uses appropriate Snowflake data types, and adheres to best practices.
   - Re-run the review process after providing the missing file.
